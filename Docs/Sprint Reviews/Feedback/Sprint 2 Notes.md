- Main focus is the communication with the robot

# Next sprint: 

- ST:
    - Talk with the robot via Ethernet (CRI) from the PLC ()
- Unity:
    - ADS implementation in Unity
    - Dynamic speed change in simulation
    - Ability to stop the conveyor belt
    - Position of the object => relative to the objects
